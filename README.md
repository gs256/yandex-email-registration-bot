# yandex-email-registration-bot
I have found an interesting feature: yandex image recognition system is so smart that it can recognize the text on their own captchas! 
It alows you to register an infinite amount of yandex email accounts without specifying the phone number.

This script uses headless browser to register yandex accounts.
As in turned out, this script is actually useless, because these accounts are quickly getting banned.
